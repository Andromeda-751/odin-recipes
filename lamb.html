            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>A rack of lamb is topped with a herby crust before it's roasted. 
                   I have been using this recipe for a long time, and always enjoy making it. 
                   You can also do the same thing with beef or pork.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/2 cup fresh bread crumbs</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 (7 bone) rack of lamb, trimmed and frenched</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Move the oven rack to the center position.</li>
                    <li>Combine bread crumbs, garlic, rosemary, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl; 
                        stir in 2 tablespoons olive oil to moisten the mixture. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Season rack of lamb all over with 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons olive 
                        oil in a large heavy oven-proof skillet over high heat. Add lamb and sear on all sides, about 1 to 2 minutes: 
                        set lamb aside for a few minutes. Brush lamb with mustard and roll in bread crumb mixture until evenly coated. 
                        Cover the ends of the bones with foil to prevent charring.</li>
                    <li>Arrange the breaded rack of lamb bone-side down in the same skillet. Roast in preheated oven for 12 to 18 minutes for 
                        medium; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 130 degrees F (54 degrees C), or 
                        continue to cook to desired doneness. Remove lamb from the skillet and allow to rest for 5 to 7 minutes, 
                        loosely covered with foil, before carving between the ribs.</li>
                </ol>
